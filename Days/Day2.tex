\section{Day 2}

We had our meeting today and Sophia presented. We spent a lot of time proving that finitely generated groups were countable. And that Frattini Groups were actually Groups. We didn't end up proving it in the end, it's actually hard. But this week's readings are all of Chapter 15 in Office Hours. I will be presenting!
\subsubsection{Finitely Generated Groups are Countable}

I already proved this
\subsubsection{Frattini Group}
Let $\mathbb{F}$ be the Frattini subgroup of a group $G$. It is immediate that the group identity exists in $\mathbb{F}$. Now let $x,y\in\mathbb{F}$ be arbitrary, but then to obtain a contradiction suppose that $xy\notin\mathbb{F}$. Then it follows that there exists a generating set $S$ such that $S\backslash xy$ doesn't generate $G$. But then we may notice that $(S\backslash xy)\cup\{x,y\}$ necessarily generates $G$. Then since we have that $x,y$ are non generators, we must also have that $[(S\backslash xy)\cup\{x,y\}]\backslash\{x,y\}=S\backslash xy$ Generates $G$. But this contradicts that it doesn't generate $G$, so it must follow that $xy$ is also a non generator.\footnote{I'm not sure if this proof is actually correct, but Vivian is ghosting me on whether it is or not :(}
