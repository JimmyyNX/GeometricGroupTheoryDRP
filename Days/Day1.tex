\section{Day 1 : Introductions}
This is for the Directed Reading Program hosted by the Mathematics Graduate Student Association. This specific group is lead by \href{https://www.math.toronto.edu/vivianhe/Home.html}{Vivian He}, and we will be reading about Geometric Group Theory. We've decided on the books
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691158662/office-hours-with-a-geometric-group-theorist}{Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist - M. Clay and D. Margalit}
    \item\href{https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~kapovich/EPR/ggt.pdf}{Geometric Group Theory - C. Dru≈£u and M. Kapovich}
\end{itemize}
This Latex file will mostly keep track of the general content that we will be covering/already have covered, but I'll be adding some related examples and whatever that I learn about during this time, I'll try my best to keep them in the subsubsections. I'll also be trying to add my own solutions to the various exercises across both books.
We'll be mostly following GGT but if it gets too intense we'll switch to Office hours. This weeks readings are Chapters 7-7.4 in GGT and 7.5 if you're up to it.
